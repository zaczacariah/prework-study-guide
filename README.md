# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The Prework Study Guide was created to assist a student in understanding the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, Git and Javascript.
This was created to allow this knowledge to be collected in a single place. As a student will encounter many questions as they learn, having a place for this information to be stored is of great benefit.
I learnt the basic of these four areas and was able to deploy it.
